                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Earthquake</h2>
              <p class="center">An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the ground caused by the release of energy from the Earth's crust due to tectonic plate movements. These movements typically occur along fault lines where plates interact at boundaries. Earthquakes are measured by magnitude, which indicates the energy released, and intensity, which describes the effects and damage. They can cause ground shaking, surface ruptures, and secondary effects like landslides and tsunamis. Preparedness involves securing furniture, having an emergency kit, and knowing how to protect yourself during the event.</p>

                <img src="flood.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Flood</h2>
              <p class="center">A flood occurs when water overflows onto normally dry land due to excessive rainfall, melting snow, or other factors. Floods can result from natural events like heavy storms or rapid snowmelt, as well as human activities such as dam failures or poor drainage systems. They can cause widespread damage to property, infrastructure, and ecosystems, and pose serious risks to human safety. Floods are measured by their depth, extent, and duration, with severity ranging from minor inundation to catastrophic deluge. Preparedness involves having an emergency plan, knowing evacuation routes, and protecting property with barriers or elevation measures.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Hurricane</h2>
              <p class="center">A hurricane is a powerful tropical storm characterized by strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surges, typically forming over warm ocean waters. Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds on the Saffir-Simpson scale, ranging from Category 1 (least severe) to Category 5 (most severe). They can cause significant damage through high winds, flooding, and coastal erosion. Preparedness includes having an emergency kit, following evacuation orders, and securing property against wind and water damage. The impact of a hurricane can be severe, often leading to widespread destruction and long-term recovery efforts.</p>

                <img src="fire.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Wildfire</h2>
              <p class="center">A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that spreads rapidly through vegetation such as forests, grasslands, or brush, often fueled by dry conditions, strong winds, and flammable materials. They can be ignited by natural causes like lightning or human activities such as campfires or discarded cigarettes. Wildfires pose significant risks to lives, property, and ecosystems, causing extensive damage and loss. Preparedness includes creating defensible space around properties, having an emergency evacuation plan, and staying informed about fire conditions and alerts. Wildfires can be challenging to control, often requiring coordinated efforts from firefighting agencies and local communities.</p>
